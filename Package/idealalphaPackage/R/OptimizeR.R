#' This package can be used to justify the alpha level based on changes in probability of a hypothesis.
#'
#' It includes four functions to justify alpha in different ways as well as two more functions to calculate the posterior probability of H1 after testing for a given alpha level.
#'
#' @section Idealalpha:
#' \emph{idealalpha} calculates the alpha level with the most informational value.
#'
#' @section AlphaConfirmation:
#' \emph{alphaConfirmation} calculates the alpha level needed to achieve a specific posterior probability after a significant result.
#'
#' @section AlphaDisconfirmation:
#' \emph{alphaDisconfirmation} calculates the alpha level needed to achieve a specific posterior probability after a non significant result.
#'
#' @section Probability Based Power Analysis:
#' \emph{probpower} calculates the alpha level, power, and sample size needed to achieve a specific posterior probability after both a significant and non significant result.
#'
#' @section Postconfirm:
#' \emph{postconfirm} calculates the posterior probability after a significant result.
#'
#' @section Postdisconfirm:
#' \emph{postdisconfirm} calculates the posterior probability after a non significant result.
